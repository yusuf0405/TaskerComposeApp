## Libraries

* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s
  recommended modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on
  Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

* [Kotlin flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) In coroutines, a flow is a type that can
  emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single
  value. For example, you can use a flow to receive live updates from a database.

* [Kotlin Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) Coroutines is a rich library for
  coroutines developed by JetBrains. It contains a number of high-level primitives with support for
  coroutines, which are discussed in this guide, including startup, asynchrony, and others.

* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) Data related to
  the user interface that is not destroyed when the application is rotated. Easily schedule
  asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.

* [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) The Room persistence library
  provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while
  harnessing the full power of SQLite.

* [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) An interface
  that automatically responds to lifecycle events.

* [Compose-Destinations](https://github.com/raamcosta/compose-destinations?ysclid=llpa5lprz4866685466)
  A KSP library that processes annotations and generates code that uses Official Jetpack Compose
  Navigation under the hood. It hides the complex, non-type-safe and boilerplate code you would have
  to write otherwise.
  No need to learn a whole new framework to navigate - most APIs are either the same as with the
  Jetpack Components or inspired by them.

* [Compose-Color-Picker](https://github.com/godaddy/compose-color-picker?ysclid=llpa741gkh137824455)A
component that provides two different HSV color pickers, written in Jetpack Compose.
